1. Policy Proposals:
- Carefully read the text to identify *concrete and specific* policy proposals.
- A valid policy proposal MUST:
  * Be a specific, actionable governmental commitment
  * Contain a clear, measurable action or initiative
  * Be concise (single short sentence), could fit in a tweet (280 characters)
- Do NOT include:
  * Vague ideological statements
  * General party values or principles without specific actions
  * Rhetorical flourishes or campaign slogans
  * Background information or contextual details
- Summarize each distinct proposal concisely, focusing *only* on the core action. Avoid including surrounding justification or filler text from the source. Aim for quality over quantity â€“ extract only truly specific actions.
- If the text contains NO specific policy proposals, provide an empty list.
- Translate any non-English proposals into English.
- Provide the proposals as a list under field name: policy_proposals.

2. Sentiment:
- Evaluate only the *emotional tone* (not content or ideology).
- Select exactly ONE option: "positive" (optimistic, encouraging), "negative" (critical, pessimistic), or "neutral" (balanced, matter-of-fact).
- Provide this value under field name: sentiment.

3. Topic:
- Identify the *single, most dominant* political topic discussed in the chunk.
- Choose ONE specific keyword in English (avoid combining multiple topics).
- Common topics include but are NOT limited to: "economy", "healthcare", "education", "migration", "security", "environment", "foreign policy", "culture", "democracy", "justice".
- DO NOT use compound topics - select the most central focus only.
- Provide the chosen keyword under field name: topic.

4. Hate Speech Analysis:
- Analyze the text for hate speech based on the provided definition (hostility/prejudice/discrimination against groups based on characteristics).
- For field hate_speech:
  a. Set to true ONLY if the text contains explicit hostility, encourages discrimination, or promotes prejudice against identifiable groups.
  b. For subfield reason:
    - If hate speech is present: Quote SPECIFIC phrases and explain how they constitute hate speech.
    - If no hate speech: Leave empty.
  c. For subfield targeted_groups: List ONLY groups explicitly targeted (if any) or leave empty.
- If hate_speech is false, targeted_groups should be empty.
- Place values under field name: hate_speech.

5. Political Compass Analysis:
- Assess political orientation using two axes, each represented as a float between -1 and 1:
  a. Economic axis (economic):
  - -1.0: Strongly left (e.g., strong support for wealth redistribution, expanded public services, market regulation, nationalization)
  -  0.0: Center (mixed approach, balancing market principles with social welfare or targeted regulation)
  - +1.0: Strongly right (e.g., strong support for tax reduction, privatization, deregulation, free market emphasis, cutting government spending)
  - Use intermediate values for nuanced positions (e.g., -0.5 for moderately left, +0.5 for moderately right).
  b. Social axis (social):
  - -1.0: Strongly libertarian (emphasizes personal freedoms, minimal state intervention in private life, civil liberties expansion)
  -  0.0: Center (balanced approach to personal freedoms and societal order)
  - +1.0: Strongly authoritarian (emphasizes order, discipline, social conformity, expanded state powers over individuals)
- Use intermediate values for nuanced positions (e.g., -0.5 for moderately libertarian, +0.5 for moderately authoritarian).
- Provide selections under field name: political_compass with subfields economic (float, -1 to 1) and social (float, -1 to 1).
